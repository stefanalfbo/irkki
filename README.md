**Irkki** is an open-source IRC (Internet Relay Chat) client, built as a hobby project to deepen my understanding of the IRC protocol and to explore the capabilities of the [C# Spectre.Console library](https://github.com/spectreconsole/spectre.console). The name **irkki** is derived from a less official Finnish abbreviation for IRC.
