**Irkki** is an open-source IRC (Internet Relay Chat) client, built as a hobby project to deepen my understanding of the IRC protocol and to explore the capabilities of the [C# Spectre.Console library](https://github.com/spectreconsole/spectre.console). The name irkki is a nod to the Finnish origins of IRC, as it was a Finnish individual, Jarkko "WiZ" Oikarinen, who created the first IRC client. *Irkki* is indeed a colloquial Finnish term for IRC, reflecting the protocol's roots in Finland.
